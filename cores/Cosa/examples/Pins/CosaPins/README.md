Demonstration of Cosa Pin abstraction. Sketch pin usage is declarative
and object-oriented.  

Circuit
-------
Connect pin 2 a button/switch with pullup resistor, pin 5 to a LED
with a resistor (330-1Kohm), pin 7 should also be connected to a
button/switch, and pin 14 (analog pin 0) should be connected to a
potentmeter so that the voltage may vary between VCC and ground.
