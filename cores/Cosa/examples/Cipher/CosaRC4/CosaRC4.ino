"RC4 was initially a trade secret, but in September 1994 a description\n"
"of it was anonymously posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list.[4] It was\n"
"soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, and from there to many sites on\n"
"the Internet. The leaked code was confirmed to be genuine as its output\n"
"was found to match that of proprietary software using licensed RC4.\n"
"Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret.\n"
"The name RC4 is trademarked, so RC4 is often referred to as ARCFOUR\n"
"or ARC4 (meaning alleged RC4) to avoid trademark problems. RSA Security\n"
"has never officially released the algorithm; Rivest has, however,\n"
"linked to the English Wikipedia article on RC4 in his own course notes.\n"
"RC4 has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and\n"
"standards, including WEP and WPA for wireless cards and TLS.\n"
"\n"
"The main factors in RC4's success over such a wide range of applications\n"
"are its speed and simplicity: efficient implementations in both software\n"
"and hardware are very easy to develop.\n";
