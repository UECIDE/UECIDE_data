 * @section Description
 * Demonstration of the DHT11 and Virtual Wire Interface (VWI) driver.
 * Transmits a simple message with humidity and temperature readings
 * from DHT11. The messages may be monitored with the CosaVWIreceiver
 * or the CosaVWIdebug sketch.
 *
 * @section Circuit
 * Connect RF433/315 Transmitter Data to Arduino/ATtiny84/85 D9/D3/D3,
 * and DHT11 data with pullup (approx. 5 Kohm) to D7/D10/D2. 
 * The LED (ATtiny84/85 D4/D5) is on when transmitting.
 *
 * This file is part of the Arduino Che Cosa project.
