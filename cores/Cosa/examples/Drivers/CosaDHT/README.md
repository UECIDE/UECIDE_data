Demonstration of Cosa DHT11/DHT22 Humidity & Temperature Sensor device
driver. Sample and print values. 

Circuit
-------
For this example you need a DHT11 and a DHT22 sensor/module. There are
modules available with both power LED and pullup resistor. 
Connect Arduino:D2 to DHT11 data pin. Connect D3 to DHT22 data 
pin. Pullup resistors (4K7) necessary if long wires. Internal 
pullup active. Connect power (VCC) and ground (GND).
