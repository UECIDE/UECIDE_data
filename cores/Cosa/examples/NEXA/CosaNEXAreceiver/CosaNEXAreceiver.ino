 * @section Description
 * Simple sketch to demonstrate receiving Nexa Home Wireless Switch
 * Remote codes. First command received will be used as the device 
 * identity. Sucessive commands are dispatched through the Listener.
 * The built-in LED is set on/off according to the command when the
 * address of the command matches.. See Also CosaNEXAsender if you 
 * wish to run the sketch without a NEXA remote control.
 *
 * This file is part of the Arduino Che Cosa project.
