=================
Demonstration sending temperature readings from a OneWire DS18B20
device over the Virtual Wire Interface (VWI). 

This sketch is designed for an ATtiny85 running on the internal 
8 MHz clock. Receive measurements with the CosaVWItempmonitor or
CosaVWIdebug sketch.

Circuit
-------
Connect RF433/315 Transmitter Data to ATtiny85 D1, connect VCC 
GND. Connect one or two 1-Wire digital thermometer to D2 with pullup
resistor (approx. 4.7 Kohm), connect VCC and GND. In parasite mode connect
thermometer VCC pin also to GND. For power control connect the pull
resistor to D3.
