CosaAT24CXX
===========

Cosa demonstration of the AT24CXX 2-Wire (TWI) Serial EEPROM
driver. Reads and updates 32-bytes in the first page of a AT24CXX
device. 

Circuit
-------
The Arduino analog pins 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL) are used for I2C/TWI
connection. Pullup resistors are not needed in this example as the
internal pullup resistors are enabled. 

The serial EEPROM is assumed to have sub-address 0b000.
