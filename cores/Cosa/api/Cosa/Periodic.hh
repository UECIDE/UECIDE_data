 * Periodic function handler. Syntactic sugar for watchdog timeout

 * Avoid setting period to the same value in the run method as this
 * will force the function to be executed twice in the same time frame. 
 *
 * @section See Also
 * For details on time period handling see Watchdog.hh. This execution
 * pattern is also available in the FSM (Finite State Machine) class.
