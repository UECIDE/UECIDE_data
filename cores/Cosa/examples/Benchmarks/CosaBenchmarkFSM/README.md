CosaBenchmarkFSM
================

The classical finite state machine benchmark with measurement of event
send time. The machine has only one state and for each received event
sends an event to a connected machine. 

The measurement contains the pushing of the event onto the event
queue, pulling and dispatch of the event to the receiving state
machine.
