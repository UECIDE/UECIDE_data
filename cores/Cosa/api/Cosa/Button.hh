/**
 * Debounded Button; Sampled input pin (with internal pullup
 * resistor). Uses a watchdog timeout event (64 ms) for sampling and
 * on change calls an event action. Subclass Button and implement the
 * virtual on_change() method. Use the subclass for any state needed
 * for the action function. Connect button/switch from pin to
 * ground. Internal pull-up resistor is activated. 
 *
 * @section Limitations
 * Button toggle faster than sample period may be missed. This is the
 * case when connecting to a Rotary Encoder.
 * 
 * @section See Also
 * The Button event handler requires the usage of an event dispatch. 
 * See Event.hh.
