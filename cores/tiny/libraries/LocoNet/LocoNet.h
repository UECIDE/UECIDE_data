 * 	DESCRIPTION
 * 	This module provides functions that manage the sending and receiving of LocoNet packets.
 * 	
 * 	As bytes are received from the LocoNet, they are stored in a circular
 * 	buffer and after a valid packet has been received it can be read out.
 * 	
 * 	When packets are sent successfully, they are also appended to the Receive
 * 	circular buffer so they can be handled like they had been received from
 * 	another device.
 * 
 * 	Statistics are maintained for both the send and receiving of packets.
 * 
 * 	Any invalid packets that are received are discarded and the stats are
 * 	updated approproately.

/************************************************************************************
	The LocoNet fast clock in the Command Station is driven from a 65.535 ms
    time base. A normal minute takes approximately 915 x 65.535 ms ticks.

	The LocoNet fast clock values are stored in a special slot in the Command
	Station called the fast clock slot which is slot number 0x7B or 123
	
	Each of the fields in the slot are supposed to count up until the most significant bit
	is 0x80 and then rollover the appropriate values and reset however this behaviour
	does not seem to hold for all fields and so some corrction factors are needed

	An important part of syncing to the Fast Clock master is to interpret the current
	FRAC_MINS fields so that a Fast Clock Slave can sync to the part minute and then
	rollover it's accumulators in sync with the master. The FRAC_MINS counter is a
	14 bit counter that is stored in the two 7 bit FRAC_MINSL & FRAC_MINSH fields.
	It counts up the FRAC_MINSL field until it rolls over to 0x80 and then increments
	the FRAC_MINSH high field until it rolls over to 0x80 and then increments the minute,
	hour and day fields as appropriate and then resets the FRAC_MINS fields to 0x4000 - 915
	which is stored in each of the 7 bit fields.
 
	HOWEVER when the DCS100 resets FRAC_MINS fields to 0x4000 - 915, it then immediately
	rolls over a 128 count and so the minute is short by 915 - 128 65.535 ms ticks, so it
	runs too fast. To correct this problem the fast clock slot can be overwritten with
	corrected FRAC_MINS field values that the DCS100 will then increment correctly.

	This implementation of a LocoNet Fast Clock Slave has two features to correct these
	short commings:
	
	A) It has the option to reduce the FRAC_MINS count by 128 so that it keeps in step with
	the DCS100 Fast Clock which normally runs too fast. This is enabled by passing in the
	FC_FLAG_DCS100_COMPATIBLE_SPEED flag bit to the init() function. 
	
	B) It has the option to overwrite the LocoNet Fast Clock Master slot values with corrected
	FRAC_MINS fields imediately after it rolls-over the fast minute, to make the DCS100 not run
	too fast as it normally does.	
	
	There also seems to be problems with the hours field not rolling over correctly from 23
	back to 0 and so there is extra processing to work out the hours when it has rolled over
	to 0x80 or 0x00 by the time the bit 7 is cleared. This seems to cause the DT400 throttle
	problems as well and so when running in FC_FLAG_MINUTE_ROLLOVER_SYNC mode, this should
	be corrected. 

	The DT400 throttle display seems to decode the minutes incorrectly by 1 count and so we
	have to make the same interpretation here which is why there is a 127 and not a 128
    roll-over for the minutes.
